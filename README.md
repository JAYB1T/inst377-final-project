# Title
INST377 Final Project

# Description
This project is a web application created for people interested in stock information and dogs. It allows users to explore stock data using the Polygon API and view dog images and breed information using public dog APIs. It also has basic voice command functionality via the Annyang library.

The site consists of three main pages:
- Home: A welcome page with navigation and voice control tips.
- Stocks: A page to visualize stock prices over time using a line chart.
- Dogs: A fun page with a carousel of random dog pictures and dynamically loaded breed buttons that fetch breed-specific info.

# Target Browsers
The site is designed and tested to work on all modern desktop browsers, including:
- Google Chrome 
- Microsoft Edge 
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
